# restart_test_sp800-90b
Two programs to implement the SP800-90B restart test.

restart_slicer takes 1000 binary files captured in accordance with the SP800-90B restart test requirements and formats the data into the matrix format used by the NIST SP800-90B entropy assesment suite and with the restart_sanity_check program that comes with this repo.

restart_sanity_checker implements the SP800-90B restart sanity check and takes in the matrix file generated by restart_slicer.

$ restart_slicer -h
Usage: restart_slicer [-l <bits_per_symbol 1-8>][-B|-L][-v][-h][-o <out filename>] [filename_glob_pattern]
       -l , --length <bits_per_symbol 1-8> Set the number of bits to encode in eat output byte
       -s , --skip <bits_per_symbol 1-8> Number of bytes to skip in each binary file
       -r , --reverse                      Interpret input binary data as big endian (MSB first) (default is little endian)
       -B , --bigendian                    Unpack output multi-bit symbols as big-endian (msb first)
       -L , --littleendian                 Unpack output multi-bit symbols as little-endian (lsb first) (default)
       -v , --verbose                      Output information to stderr
       -h , --help                         Output this information

$ restart_sanity_check -h
Usage: restart_sanity_checker -e <H_I> <filename>
       -e , --H_I              Output Initial Entropy Estimate
       -v , --verbose          Output information to stderr
       -h , --help             Output this information

Perform Restart Sanity test on matrix file in NIST Oddball restart format in SP800-90B.
